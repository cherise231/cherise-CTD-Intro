    <p>“This was one of the best parts of being a coder, and an artist: the thrill of being in the middle of creating
        something delightful. It’s like the anticipation of eating freshly baked bread after its aroma fills the room.”
        – Dr. Joy Buolamwini, Unmasking AI</p>

        <p>“Programming isn’t about what you know; it’s about what you can figure out.” – Chris Pine, Learn to Program</p>
